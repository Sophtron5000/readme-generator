# readme-generator

## Description 

Here I have created a read me generator. Created using Node.JS and the NPM packages Inquirer, FS, and Path. The interface is through the command line using Node.js. Inquirer is used to generate the questions and responses. FS is used to create the MarkDown file and write to the document. Path is used to pass through the data. 

Testing and debugging proved to be the biggest challenge.
